# Redis-Exploitation

This script exploits unauthenticated write access to redis servers. 

- Bruteforce script can burteforce users from the target system.
- Exploit script will try and replace the ssh key of the user with the attackers key.

## Note: Proceeed with caution as the script will delete all existing keys from the redis cache to write a fresh key.


i ported this script from a old python2 script by  https://github.com/iw00tr00t/Redis-Server-Exploit/blob/master/redis.py. Added another script to bruteforce usernames on the target system.
